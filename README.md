# Google Books API Project
A simple site to search and display results from the Google Books library. Created in React as an exercise on working with pre-existing REST APIs.

# Instructions
Download the project files, and run the following commands in the main directory: 
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will start a local instance of the website. You should be able to perform searches and browse the Google Books library.  
NOTE: The data can be a bit inconsistent, but this is an issue with the API and not my code
